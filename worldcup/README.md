# World Cup Database Project

## Overview
This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification. It involves creating a PostgreSQL database to track World Cup game results for the final three rounds of each tournament since 2014. The project is structured in steps for database creation, data import from a CSV file, and querying specific data.

## Project Structure
Each project component is organized in the following directories and files:

```
worldcup/
├── data/
│   └── games.csv           # Data file containing all games for final rounds since 2014
├── output/
│   └── expected_output.txt  # Expected output from queries to validate project completion
├── scripts/
│   ├── database.sh         # Script to set up the database structure (tables)
│   ├── insert_data.sh      # Script to populate the database with data from games.csv
│   ├── queries.sh          # Script with SQL queries to retrieve specific information
│   └── worldcup.sql        # SQL dump of the database for backup or restoration
```

## File Descriptions
- **data/games.csv**: CSV file with data for World Cup games, including year, round, teams, and scores.
- **output/expected_output.txt**: Reference file with expected output for each query in `queries.sh`, enabling accuracy checks.
- **scripts/database.sh**: Bash script to create the PostgreSQL database structure. It initializes tables with constraints and foreign keys for the World Cup data.
- **scripts/insert_data.sh**: Populates tables with data from `games.csv`, handling team data insertion and association with game data.
- **scripts/queries.sh**: Contains queries designed to fetch specific data from the database, fulfilling the user stories for this project.
- **scripts/worldcup.sql**: SQL dump file for recreating the database structure and data in one step. Useful for backup or migrating the project.

## Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL on your system.
- **Bash Terminal**: Needed to run shell scripts (.sh files) for setup and data insertion.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create the Database
1. Log into PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres
   ```
2. Run `database.sh` to create the worldcup database and tables:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/database.sh
   ```
3. Connect to the worldcup database:
   ```bash
   psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=worldcup
   ```

### Part 2: Insert Data
1. Run the `insert_data.sh` script to populate the database from `games.csv`:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/insert_data.sh
   ```
2. Check table contents to confirm successful data insertion.

### Part 3: Query the Database
1. Edit `queries.sh` to complete the empty echo commands with SQL queries.
2. Verify each query by comparing its output to `expected_output.txt`.
3. Test queries in the psql prompt before adding them to the script.

## Backup and Restoration
To create a backup:
```bash
pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp worldcup > scripts/worldcup.sql
```
This command creates `worldcup.sql`, which can rebuild the database if needed:
```bash
psql -U postgres < scripts/worldcup.sql
```

## Additional Notes
- **Database Reset**: `TRUNCATE TABLE` in `database.sh` can be used to clear tables for fresh data insertion.
- **Final Checks**: Ensure all queries produce outputs that match `expected_output.txt`.
- **Submission**: After passing tests, upload `worldcup.sql`, `insert_data.sh`, and `queries.sh` to a public GitHub repository for FreeCodeCamp verification.
